>Scratch Extensions make it possible to connect Scratch projects with external hardware (such as LEGO WeDo or PicoBoard) or sources of information on the web. They add a collection of command and reporter blocks that can be used to interact with a particular device or data source. When an extension is enabled, its blocks appear in the “More Blocks” palette.  For more information, see the Scratch Wiki.

##Repository Organization
Each folder in the root of this repository(excluding wiki-res) is an individual extension, and no extension is dependent on another.
